Description: This is a D3 implementation of an array simulated dary-heap. This project's code is based on the opendatastructes.org algorithms and Robin Ladiges heap implementation.

Instructions: 
Select one of the "max" or "min" radio buttons then pressing the change button to changing heap type.
Selecting a degree (number of children) and a node count will generate a heap with those specifications (if left empty a random number will be picked).
The change degree button will create a new heap with the selected number of children.
The add button adds elements to the heap.
The remove button removes the top element of the heap.
On the array in the array representation section: Use the mouse to pan (click and move) / zoom (scrollwheel)
